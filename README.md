# Module 1
# Understanding cloud computing
* The chapter provides an introduction to cloud computing, explaining its core concepts, benefits, and different deployment models (public, private, hybrid).
  
Initially, cloud adoption focused on cost savings, but now businesses leverage it for transformation. Most organizations use a hybrid cloud approach, combining public cloud services with their own data centers for specific needs.

The cloud market offers various specialized services like storage and machine learning to cater to diverse customer requirements. This chapter lays the groundwork for understanding hybrid and multicloud environments that are becoming increasingly common.

 # 5 CHARACTERISTICS
 
 # ON DEMAND SELF-SERVICE:
* they are designed to be self-service. you can get the resources you need, like storage  or computing power, on demand and withou needing to contact the provider directly. you can easily scale reasurces up or down as your needs change.

# BROAD NETWORK ACCESS:  
here services are accessible from anywhere with an internet connection or local network connection (Accessibility). This allows traditional evices and servers to leverage cloud resources globally (benefit).

* RESOURCE POOLING: (cloud service provider), CPU pool resources using a multi-tenant model and allocate resources on demand. They abstract the physical location of the resources from the consumer. Consumers dont need to know or care where the resources are located. This allows for dynamic allocation and efficient resource utilization (benefits).

# RAPID ELASTICITY( clod computing offers flexible resource scaling):
* Resources (like servers) can be automatically or manually added or removed based on real-time demand.
* This is different from traditional models where fixed server capacity is purchased, leading to under-utilization and wasted costs.
* Cloud computing allows for dynamic allocation, so you only pay for what you use. This is especially beneficial for businesses with fluctuating resource needs (e.g., retail during holidays).

# measured service ( cloud providers closely track how much of their resources which are storage, computer,power etc) one use. This metering allowa for:
* Efficient resource allocation: By understanding usage patterns, providers can optimize resource distribution.
* Accurate billing: You only pay for what you use, as the bill reflects your exact resource consumption.


# CLOUD COMPUTING ECOSYSTEM EHICH CONSIST OF 3 CATEGORIES:

# CONSUMER SERVICES: 
Everyday people are considerd as "everyday end-users" of cloud services. we use these services for our daily tasks without needing to know how they work behind the scenes. Examples include services like Microsoft OneDrive, GoogleDrive and, I cloud that let us store files, access thenm from anywhere, and even collaborate eith others.

# PROVIDER OF SERVICES: 
* Amazon Web Services (AWS):  Offers a massive selection of services from compute power to AI and machine learning.
* Microsoft Azure: Strong for building and managing applications in Microsoft's data centers.
* Google Cloud Platform (GCP): Geared towards helping businesses grow and innovate with its cloud solutions, including AI and data analytics.
* IBM Cloud: Provides a mix of infrastructure, platform, and software services along with data and AI tools.
* Oracle Cloud Infrastructure: Focuses on enterprise needs with cloud services for compute, storage, databases, and applications.
* Alibaba Cloud: A major player in Asia, offering a broad range of cloud services with strengths in AI and security

# DESIGNER OF SERVICES: 
These are consulting firms that help businesses design, implement, and manage cloud technologies. They offer expertise in areas like cloud strategy, architecture, migration, and optimization. Some of the big names include Accenture, Deloitte, Capgemini, IBM, PwC, Cognizant, and Wipro.

# UNDERSTANDING CLOUD CONCEPTS: 

In simpler terms, cloud computing offers on-demand access to various resources like storage, applications, and computing power over the internet. It makes things easier by using consistent processes and automation.

Here are the key takeaways:

* Cloud computing delivers resources as a service, eliminating the need for physical installations.
* Standardization and automation are crucial for cloud operations.
* Many familiar services like Gmail and Microsoft 365 are already cloud-based.
* Cloud computing offers a wide range of resources, from data storage to business applications.

# UNDERSTANDING CLOUD DEPLOYMENT MODELS

CLOUD COMPONENTS AND CLIENTS: There are 3 main components in a clod services solution. which are CLIENT PLATFORM( which the cloud services are being accessed), DATA CENTER(clod services are being hosted) and lastly is the CONNECTION BETWEEN THOSE TWO POINTS

# CLOUD SERVICE COMPONENTS

* CSP data center: Large facilities operated by cloud service providers (CSPs) like Microsoft and Amazon. These centers house the cloud services and are built for reliability and security.
* Client: This is the user's device, like a phone, computer, or tablet, that accesses cloud services.
* Network: This is the connection between the client device and the CSP's data center. It can be private (owned by the user's organization), public (internet), or cellular.
  
# Three main cloud deployment models:

* Public cloud: The most common model, where resources are shared by many users from different organizations.
* Private cloud: Services are dedicated to a single organization for maximum control and security.
* Hybrid cloud: A combination of public and private clouds, offering flexibility and customization.

# TYPES OF CLOUD COMPUTING

# PUBLIC CLOUD: 
* Public Cloud: This is the most common model.
* The cloud infrastructure is owned and operated by a service provider (like Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure) and shared among many users.
* It's cost-effective and scalable, but offers less control and security

# Private Cloud:
* Here, the cloud infrastructure is dedicated to a single organization.
* It can be located on-premises or hosted by a service provider.
* This offers the most control and security, but can be more expensive.
  
# Hybrid Cloud: 
*This combines public and private clouds, allowing organizations to leverage the benefits of both. For example, they might use the public cloud for non-sensitive data and the private cloud for sensitive data.

# CLOUD DELIVERY MODELS
There are 3 main cloud service models:
* Infrastructure as a Service(IaaS): provides the hardware infrastructure (like virtual servers). user manage everything above the hardware.
* Platform as Service(Paas): Provides a platform for building and deploying applications. Users manage their applications and data on the platform.
* Software as a Service(Saas): Provides access to software applications over the internet. Users dont manage anything behind the software itself.
* Iaas can be public(offered by cloud providers) or (managed by an organization for internal use)

# The Computing Resources Life Cycle

• Cloud users only pay for the resources they use.
• Cloud providers must have surplus resources to meet user demands.
• Cloud provider monitors resource usage to accurately bill users.
• Self-service provisioning allows users to quickly obtain and configure resources.
• Elasticity allows resources to automatically adjust their size based on usage.
• Cloud is a federated environment consisting of workloads spread across systems.
• Workloads should be designed for the right cloud services based on their needs.
• Multicloud strategy involves using multiple cloud providers for optimal benefits.
• Workloads and data can move across cloud providers and regions.
• Management services are crucial for ensuring cloud operations meet user needs.
• Core management services include network monitoring, application health monitoring, security, governance, data management, and cloud interface management
