# Module 1 (part1) EMBRACING THE BUSINESS IMPERATIVE

This chapter discusses how cloud computing can be used by businesses to transform their IT operations and business models to be more adaptable and competitive. 
Cloud computing is seen as a way for businesses to keep up with the fast pace of innovation and disruption in today's marketplace.

# Understanding IT Transformation

*  Rise of cloud computing changes IT's role from total control to oversight and management.
* IT needs to integrate processes and data across different systems (silos).
* IT now manages both cloud and on-premises computing services.
* Legacy applications might require a transition plan due to lack of modularity.
* IT needs to ensure consistent and predictable performance in a hybrid/multicloud environment.
* Successful companies leverage cloud and cloud services for transformation.

# Escaping the IT Legacy Trap

* Legacy applications are core to business processes but difficult to update due to monolithic architecture and dependencies.
* Lifting and shifting legacy applications to the cloud is expensive and unproductive.
* Moving legacy applications requires migrating dependent applications as well.
* Legacy applications are inefficiently developed and require significant resources in the cloud.
* Modernization is the solution: remove dependencies, redesign as modular services, and rewrite frequently used services for reuse.
* Modernization is necessary to gain cloud's innovation benefits

# Perparing for the Cloud

* Cultural changes are crucial before adopting cloud strategy. Educate everyone on cloud's capabilities and limitations.
* Collaboration between IT and business units is essential. There needs to be a balance between freedom and management.
* Cloud adoption requires new skills and roles. Modernize applications or consider SaaS options. Leverage DevOps for cloud-based software building.
* Prepare for cultural change: roles and skills will need adjustments. Pilot projects, training, and hiring experienced staff can ease the transition.
* Cloud adoption is a continuous process. IT can gain new skills and opportunities. Success depends on effective cloud culture and legacy data center cleanup.
* Cloud is not an option but a tool to support business agility and flexibility.

# Building for Innovation

* Legacy applications are core to business processes but difficult to update due to monolithic architecture and dependencies.

* Moving legacy applications requires migrating dependent applications as well.
* Legacy applications are inefficiently developed and require significant resources in the cloud.
* Modernization is the solution: remove dependencies, redesign as modular services, and rewrite frequently used services for reuse.
* Modernization is necessary to gain cloud's innovation benefits

# The Business Imperatives

* Businesses can no longer rely on static applications and platforms due to the fast-paced competitive environment.
* Cloud services allow new businesses to quickly build and test services at low cost, potentially disrupting established markets.
* Modernizing IT is essential to keep up with competition and bring innovative ideas to market faster.
* A collaborative cloud strategy with key business stakeholders is necessary to get started.
* Modernize critical applications and move key workloads to the cloud.
* Decide which workloads stay on-premises and which go to the cloud.
* Choose cloud services that meet security, governance, and stability requirements.
* Limit the number of cloud vendors to reduce management complexity.
* Cloud adoption helps maintain customer and partner relationships and creates a competitive advantage.

# Optimizing Your Existing Business

* Understand how your customers interact with cloud services.
* Businesses need agility to react quickly to customer needs for change.
* Cloud platforms enable businesses to meet customer expectations for rapid transformation.
 Example: Traditional furniture store can combine physical store with cloud-based services to offer wider selection and convenience.
* Leverage existing business knowledge to build innovative cloud services.
* Experiment with new cloud-based ideas.
